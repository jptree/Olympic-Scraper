Question 2, Part A:
SELECT noc, bronze, gold FROM medal WHERE bronze > gold ORDER by bronze DESC;

Question 2, Part B:
SELECT * FROM medal WHERE rank IN (SELECT rank FROM medal GROUP BY rank HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);

Question 2, Part C:
SELECT ROW_NUMBER()  OVER() AS "Rank", g.noc AS "Gold", s.noc AS "Silver", b.noc as "Bronze" FROM
(SELECT ROW_NUMBER()  OVER (ORDER BY gold desc, noc ASC) as "POSITION", noc from medal) as g
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT ROW_NUMBER()  OVER (ORDER BY silver desc, noc ASC) as "POSITION", noc from medal) as s
ON g.POSITION = s.POSITION
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT ROW_NUMBER()  OVER (ORDER BY bronze desc, noc ASC) as "POSITION", noc from medal) as b
ON g.POSITION = b.POSITION;
